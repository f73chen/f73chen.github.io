description: TTC's Flexity Outlook streetcar is well-known in Both Toronto and Waterloo. To recreate this popular vehicle in SolidWorks, I took measurements of the ION light rail interior, then referenced images of Toronto's streetcar's exterior. This project took well over 25 hours due to the number of parts involved, but I enjoyed pushing the limits of my SolidWorks knowledge.
