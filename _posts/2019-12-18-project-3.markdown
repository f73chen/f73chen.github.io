description: The No-Touch-Bell is a prototype device which aims to help people with rheumatoid arthritis lift weights. These patients experience pain in their hands when handling heavy weights, but heal faster when they regularly exercise. With this device, the dumbbell is attached to the forearm via Velcro, eliminating the need for hands. The prototype was modeled in SolidWorks then 3D printed.
