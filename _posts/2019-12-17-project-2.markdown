description: This is the TTC's popular Flexity Outlook streetcar recreated in SolidWorks. I took measurements of the ION light rail in Waterloo, then referenced images of streetcars in Toronto. The project took well over 30 hours due to the number of parts involved, but I had a lot of fun learning to use SolidWorks!
