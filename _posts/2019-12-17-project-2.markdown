description: This is the TTC's popular Flexity Outlook streetcar recreated in SolidWorks. I took interior measurements of the ION light rail in Waterloo, then referenced images of Toronto streetcars. The project took well over 30 hours due to the large number of parts, but I had a lot of fun in learning to use SolidWorks!
