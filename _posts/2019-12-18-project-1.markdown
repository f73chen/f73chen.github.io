description: The No-Touch-Bell is a prototype device which aims to help people with rheumatoid arthritis lift weights. These patients experience pain in their hands when handling heavy weights, yet exercising is one of the best ways to heal faster. With this device, the dumbbell is attached to the forearm via Velcro, eliminating the use of hands. The prototype was modelled in SolidWorks then 3D printed.
